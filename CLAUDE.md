# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Unofficial Android client for Yandex.Music (`dev.pdv.yamulite`, "YaMuLite"), Kotlin + Jetpack Compose. Single-module Gradle project. See `REPORT.md` for full feature inventory and known limitations.

## Build / install / run

All Gradle invocations need `JAVA_HOME` pointing at JDK 17 (the project's Kotlin compiler/AGP target):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am force-stop dev.pdv.yamulite
adb shell am start -n dev.pdv.yamulite/.MainActivity
```

`local.properties` must contain `sdk.dir=...`. SDK setup: `~/Library/Android/sdk` with `platform-tools`, `platforms;android-36`, `build-tools;36.1.0`, `cmdline-tools;latest`, all licenses accepted.

There are no unit tests in the project at the moment — `./gradlew test` exists but does nothing useful.

## Debugging on device

Stack traces from Compose / coroutine crashes appear in `adb logcat` filtered by app PID:

```bash
adb logcat -d --pid=$(adb shell pidof dev.pdv.yamulite | tr -d '\r')
```

When the user reports a UI error, prefer screenshotting the device — error text is rendered in the screens (Search/Favorites surface API failures via "Ошибка: ..." text) and is faster to read than parsing logs:

```bash
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/s.png && adb pull /sdcard/s.png /tmp/s.png
```

Then `Read /tmp/s.png` to view it. (`adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_WAKEUP` is blocked on MIUI/HyperOS — ask the user to wake the screen manually.)

## Version pinning that matters

Kotlin is pinned to **2.0.21** (not 2.1.x): Hilt 2.52's metadata reader cannot parse Kotlin 2.1 metadata and `:app:hiltJavaCompileDebug` fails with `Unable to read Kotlin metadata`. KSP must match Kotlin (`2.0.21-1.0.28`). Bump Hilt to ≥2.55 first if you want to move to Kotlin 2.1.

## Architecture: how the pieces talk

### Auth gate is reactive, not navigated

`AppViewModel.gate` is a `StateFlow<AuthGate>` derived from `TokenStore.tokenFlow`. `AppRoot` switches between `AuthScreen` / `MainScreen` based on `gate.token`. There is no `nav.navigate()` for sign-in transitions — when `AuthRepository.startAuth()` writes the token to DataStore, the flow re-emits and the UI flips automatically. The `gate.ready` flag (false until first DataStore emission) prevents an auth-screen flash on cold start.

### Two Retrofit instances

- `@AuthRetrofit` (`NetworkModule`) → `https://oauth.yandex.ru/`, plain OkHttp, no auth header. Used only by `AuthApi` for device flow.
- `@MusicRetrofit` (`MusicModule`) → `https://api.music.yandex.net/`, OkHttp with `AuthInterceptor`. Used by `MusicApi`.

`AuthInterceptor` reads the token via `runBlocking { tokenStore.tokenFlow.first() }`. This blocks an OkHttp worker thread (never the UI thread), which is acceptable because DataStore reads are fast.

### Yandex API DTO quirks

The Yandex API is undocumented and inconsistent. Two patterns are load-bearing in `data/music/dto/MusicDtos.kt`:

1. **Permissive defaults.** Most fields have defaults (`id: Long = 0`, `name: String = ""`) because Yandex sometimes omits them — e.g. unknown / "various" artists have no `id`. Without defaults, kotlinx-serialization throws `Field 'id' is required`. Pair this with `Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true; coerceInputValues = true }` in `NetworkModule`.

2. **`TrackDto.id` uses `FlexibleStringSerializer`** (`data/network/Serializers.kt`) because the same field arrives as a JSON string from `/users/{uid}/likes/tracks` but as a JSON number from `/search`. Don't change to `Long` — track ids can have `<id>:<albumId>` form in some flows.

Like/unlike returns `{"result":{"revision":N}}`, hence `ApiResponse<RevisionDto>`, not `ApiResponse<String>` — check the response shape before assuming the type.

### OAuth: device flow with embedded client_secret

`AuthRepository` uses the well-known community client_id `23cabbbdc6cd418abb4b39c32c41195d` and its publicly-known client_secret. These are not real secrets — Yandex's OAuth requires both for `grant_type=device_code`, and the same pair is hardcoded in every unofficial Yandex.Music library. Do not treat them as compromised credentials. If the user wants a private app, they can register at `oauth.yandex.ru/client/new` and supply their own pair.

### Stream URL resolution

`StreamUrlResolver.resolve(trackId, preferredBitrate)` does three things:

1. `GET /tracks/{id}/download-info` → list of `{codec, bitrate, downloadInfoUrl}` options. Picks highest-bitrate mp3 ≤ preferred.
2. `GET <downloadInfoUrl>` → tiny XML with `<host>`, `<path>`, `<ts>`, `<s>`. Parsed with regex (no XML library).
3. Computes `md5(SALT + path[1:] + s)` and assembles `https://{host}/get-mp3/{md5}/{ts}{path}`. The `SALT` (`XGRlBW9FXlekgbPrRHuSiA`) is the documented community constant.

Only `mp3` codec is implemented. Other codecs use different signed-URL prefixes (`get-aac`, etc.).

### Playback prefers local files

`AudioPlayer.playCurrent()` checks `DownloadManager.localPath(trackId)` before resolving a streaming URL. Downloaded tracks play from `file://...` with no network call. The same `AudioPlayer` instance backs all UI surfaces — `Search`, `Favorites`, and `NowPlaying` ViewModels inject it directly. The "queue" is just whichever list (search results / liked tracks) the user tapped from; that list is passed to `play(tracks, startIndex)`.

### Downloads

`DownloadManager` writes to `context.filesDir/tracks/{trackId}.mp3` (no runtime permissions needed for internal storage). It exposes a `StateFlow<Map<String, DownloadInfo>>` that the entire UI observes. Filenames replace `:` with `_` for safety; the startup scan reverses this.

Downloads run in a singleton `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.IO)` and do not survive process death. There is no WorkManager.

### Coil uses the shared OkHttp

`YaMuLiteApp` implements `SingletonImageLoader.Factory` and injects the singleton `OkHttpClient` via Hilt — Coil shares the connection pool with API calls. Disk cache: 64 MB at `cacheDir/coil_covers`.

## Testing changes that touch the API

Yandex DTO surprises are the most common source of bugs. When adding endpoints or fields:

- Add new optional fields with defaults (`= null` / `= 0` / `= ""`).
- If a field can be either string or number, use `@Serializable(with = FlexibleStringSerializer::class)`.
- If unsure of the response shape, log the body via `HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY` first (currently `BASIC`).
- A failed deserialization in a coroutine launched inside a ViewModel will crash the app unless wrapped in `runCatching` — `MusicRepository.like/unlike` already do this; new mutations should follow the same pattern.

## Out of scope (intentionally not implemented)

- Background playback / `MediaSessionService` / media notification.
- Token refresh on expiry.
- Logout button (clear app data via system settings to re-auth).
- Lossless / aac / opus codecs.
- Seek bar / position display.
- Resumable downloads.
- Pagination of search / favorites results.

See `REPORT.md` § 5 for the complete list. Don't add these without explicit user request.
